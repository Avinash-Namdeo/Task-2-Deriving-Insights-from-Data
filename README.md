# Task-5-Deriving-Insights-from-Data
# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project performs basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, sourced from Kaggle.

## Overview
- A *scatter plot* showing the relationship between passengers' Age and Pclass (Passenger Class).
- A *histogram* displaying the survival distribution among passengers.

## Data Source
 Kaggle

## Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Instructions
1. Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Generate the scatter plot (Age vs Pclass).
3. Generate the histogram for Survived distribution.

## Observations
- Most passengers were in the third class, and passengers were of various ages across all classes.
- The number of passengers who did not survive was significantly higher than those whoÂ survived.
